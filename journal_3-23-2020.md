## Beginning of Online Classes

In this time, I find that for the most part, outside of not being in a physical class, my classes don't change much. 
- Discussion is handled through text posts on Canvas or Drive for 3 of my classes
- Walden comments are still undertaken
- As a transition, I don't feel like it is too difficult
