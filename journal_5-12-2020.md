## Groupwork through Quarantine

Using Slack, my group was able to communicate to figure out what was needed.

The timeline was quickly finished by Danielle, but I would go back and edit it several times:

- Fixed spelling errors
- Revised some sections to better flow
- Fixed grammatical errors
- Adjusted tenses

Noah and I started working on the blog post together when we first started, with the others adding to it later.

On top of adding to the blog post, I also edited the blog post as we went, giving it a similar treatment to the timeline.
