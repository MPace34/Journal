# Working With TEI

Working with TEI was a whole new experience for me.
At first, I was intimidated working with it for a few reasons with transcribing a section of Walden:

- The commands and notation needed took a bit of time to adapt to
- I have immense trouble reading script, especially Thoreau's handwriting
- Adding in the deletions and additions seemed daunting when I was just starting out

But as I progressed through working with it, my confidence rose:

- Getting in close, I was able to start deciphering Thoreau's script
- Looking at the sample xml file shared with us, the work was not nearly as difficult as I imagined
- The sample left for us allowed me to handle the added and deleted portions effectively

With the aid of the sample file, working with TEI became more fun than I had imagined!
