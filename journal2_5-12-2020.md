## Final Thoughts on the Class

As the semester draws to a close, I just wanted to summarize my thoughts on this class:

- Looking at and commenting on Henry David Thoreau's *Walden* allowed intriguing take aways that can be applied to life now
- Working with the command line took a bit of time to get used to, but becoming more familiar with my computer was a nice outcome
- I'm still not comfortable with Python, but that will be something to work with over the summer to become more familiar
- Pushing to GitHub was an interesting task, which I did briefly forget how to do over spring break, but re-learning how to do that felt rewarding
- It was interesting working with my group over Slack. While I'm still not the biggest fan of working over Slack, it was nice having that form of contact with other students

Obviously, a lot was affected by Coronavirus and a lot had to change, but one of the biggest things I took from this class was how to adapt. Most parts of this class really reinforced me to how often we have to adapt to new situations:

- Looking at the many revisions of *Walden*, we observed how much writing changes and adapts
- The command line and GitHub was adapting to new uses of our computers
- Coronavirus had us all adapt to a new, frightening situation while still getting work done

Overall, this has been a very enjoyable class and I'm glad I took it.
