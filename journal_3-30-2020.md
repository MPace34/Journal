## Things I Learned Today

### Metareading

Metareading
- When we are looking for something to say about a text
- For example, Is it a novel or a sonnet?

Fluid Texts
- A work is not finished, it can be revised
- *Walden* went through several revisions

Through XML/TEI, Digital Thoreau put out a fluid text version of *Walden*, where we can observe the changes over time.
